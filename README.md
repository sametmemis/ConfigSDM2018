Abstract:

Since many problems have a large amount of data or uncertainty, the computer mathematics has become compulsory. To deal with such kinds of these problems, 
the concept of fuzzy parameterized fuzzy soft matrices (fpfs-matrices) has been defined by Enginoğlu. In this paper, we first give some of its basic definitions. 
We then configure some decision-making algorithms constructed by soft sets, fuzzy soft sets, fuzzy parameterized soft sets, fpfs-sets, and their matrix representations. 
We finally discuss later works.
